# Concalendar-Frontend

This repository contains the code for the **Concalendar** frontend application. It allows users to browse upcoming fan conventions across a variety of categories including anime, comics and gaming.

The app fetches data from a backend server and caches it locally for offline use. Cached data is updated either when a change is detected on the backend or when the user manually triggers a refresh.
